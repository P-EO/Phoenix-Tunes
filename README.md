## Description
Phoenix Tunes is an entertainment project developed by the Phoenix Tunes Corporation to extend entertainment to areas without Spotify or Tidal or even Deezer at a reduced price.
For more information, check out our website located at: https://guardian327rules.wixsite.com/phoenixtunes-alpha.

## Installation
You can download and install the Phoenix Tunes app from our website by clicking the "Download" button (For Windows & MAC OS only). Similarily, you can get the app on Linux (still unstable for any Linux OS) by running the installation script below:
```bash
$ curl gh repo clone Phoenix-Tunes/Phoenix-Tunes
```
If you want a specific edition of the app, you can check out: https://guardian327rules.wixsite.com/phoenixtunes-alpha/version-switch to customize your download edition.

## Usage
To use the app is the simplest part of this tutorial. All you have to do is to double click the app icon on your desktop, or home screen for mobile devices. Similarily, you can run the script below for advanced users (Linux and MAC OS only):
``` bash
phoenix-tunes
```

## Roadmap
NB: Only download your designated version. Downloading different versions for different Operating Systems is not advised as it may crash your PC, tablet, or phone i.e if you have a Windows 10 PC and you download a MAC OS version just because it has better features. Do not try to run the app using an emulator. You could crash the app version for your device. (You may no longer be able to download and install the app on your PC, unless when you have reinstalled your OS or run the app in the emulator that crashed it.)

## Description
Phoenix Tunes is an entertainment project developed by the Phoenix Tunes Corporation to extend entertainment to areas without Spotify or Tidal or even Deezer at a reduced price.

## Installation
You can download and install the Phoenix Tunes app from our website by clicking the "Download" button (For Windows & MAC OS only). Similarily, you can get the app on Linux (still unstable for any Linux OS) by running the installation script below:
```bash
nuget install phoenix-tunes
```
If you want a specific edition of the app, you can check out: https://guardian327rules.wixsite.com/phoenixtunes-alpha/version-switch to customize your download edition.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
If you need any help with the app, or you have suspected any bugs, you can join the community forum at located at: https://guardian327rules.wixsite.com/phoenixtunes-alpha/forum, or you can join our support server on Discord using the following invite link: https://discord.gg/Bda75FrX2n.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.

# Phoenix Tunes

## Description
Phoenix Tunes is an entertainment project developed by the Phoenix Tunes Corporation to extend entertainment to areas without Spotify or Tidal or even Deezer at a reduced price.
For more information, check out our website located at: https://guardian327rules.wixsite.com/phoenixtunes-alpha.

## Installation
You can download and install the Phoenix Tunes app from our website by clicking the "Download" button (For Windows & MAC OS only). Similarily, you can get the app on Linux (still unstable for any Linux OS) by running the installation script below:
```bash

```
If you want a specific edition of the app, you can check out: https://guardian327rules.wixsite.com/phoenixtunes-alpha/version-switch to customize your download edition.

## Usage
To use the app is the simplest part of this tutorial. All you have to do is to double click the app icon on your desktop, or home screen for mobile devices. Similarily, you can run the script below for advanced users (Linux and MAC OS only):
``` bash
phoenix-tunes
```
## Support
If you need any help with the app, or you have suspected any bugs, you can join the community forum at located at: https://guardian327rules.wixsite.com/phoenixtunes-alpha/forum, or you can join our support server on Discord using the following invite link: https://discord.gg/Bda75FrX2n. You can also check the dev community on Google Groups by following this link: https://groups.google.com/g/phoenix-tunes-corporation.

## Roadmap
NB: Only download your designated version. Downloading different versions for different Operating Systems is not advised as it may crash your PC, tablet, or phone i.e if you have a Windows 10 PC and you download a MAC OS version just because it has better features. Do not try to run the app using an emulator. You could crash the app version for your device. (You may no longer be able to download and install the app on your PC, unless when you have reinstalled your OS or run the app in the emulator that crashed it.)

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.
